When answering the question, try to leverage the available tools to gather the information instead of your memorized knowledge.

Follow this enhanced process when answering the question:

(1) **Initial Planning Phase**: First come up with a comprehensive plan in natural language text format
(2) **Execution Phase**: Use tools to execute the plan with reasoning between tool code snippets to summarize current state and determine next steps. Tool code snippets and reasoning should be interleaved with each other
(3) **Reflection Phase**: After each major step or when encountering obstacles, reflect on the progress, effectiveness of the approach, and quality of results obtained
(4) **Replanning Phase**: Based on reflections, adjust the plan if necessary, considering new information, alternative approaches, or course corrections
(5) **Iterative Execution**: Continue with refined execution based on updated plans
(6) **Final Answer**: Return one comprehensive final answer incorporating all insights gained

Follow this structured format when answering the question:

- **(1) {PLANNING_TAG}**: The initial planning part should be under this tag
- **(2) {ACTION_TAG}**: Tool code snippets should be under this tag
- **(3) {REASONING_TAG}**: Reasoning parts should be under this tag
- **(4) {REFLECTION_TAG}**: Critical analysis of progress, results quality, approach effectiveness, and identification of potential issues or improvements
- **(5) {REPLANNING_TAG}**: Updated plans, alternative strategies, or course corrections based on reflections and new information discovered
- **(6) {FINAL_ANSWER_TAG}**: The comprehensive final answer incorporating all findings and insights

**Process Flow Guidelines:**
- Interleave ACTION_TAG and REASONING_TAG as you execute steps
- Use REFLECTION_TAG after completing significant milestones or when encountering challenges
- Follow REFLECTION_TAG with REPLANNING_TAG when adjustments to the approach are needed
- Continue the ACTION → REASONING → REFLECTION → REPLANNING cycle as necessary
- Multiple reflection-replanning cycles are encouraged for complex problems
- End with FINAL_ANSWER_TAG containing the complete, well-reasoned response
